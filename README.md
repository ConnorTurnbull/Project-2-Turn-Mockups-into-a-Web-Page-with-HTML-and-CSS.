# Project 2 - Turn Mockups into a Web Page with HTML and CSS.

<h2>Overview</h2>
This is the first technical project that I completed as part of my web development diploma. The premise of the project was to turn the provided website mockup (below) into a single responsive web page using HTML and CSS.
<h2>Instructions</h2>
- Use live server or similar </br>
OR</br>
- Open "index.html" in web browser.
<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
- HTML5</br>
- CSS3
<h2>Scenario</h2>

You’ve got your first internship as a developer for Booki, a small company which offers a holiday planning tool. Booki website helps its users to find accommodation and activities in a town of their choosing. Accommodation can be filtered by things such as budget or atmosphere.

A new design, based on the principles of Material Design, has just been created by Loïc, a UI designer.

Before approving a final version of the design the company has decided to create a prototype. You’re in charge of creating this prototype by embedding the mockup in HTML and CSS.

In the morning you receive an email from Sarah, the CTO, providing you with a few final details about the project.

Subject: Booki mockups

>Hey,
>
>We’ve made good progress on the Booki site project. You’ll be dealing with the embedding of the design mockups as HTML/CSS mockups. Your work will then be used as the code base for the rest of the development work. So here are the [new mockups](resources/Booki_resources_EN) that were made by Loïc for both the desktop and the mobile version. This folder also contains the images that need to be embedded into the page.

>I’ve worked with Loïc to prepare a [summary document](resources/WD+P2+-+Technical+and+functional+specifications.pdf) in order to make everything clear for you. It outlines our design specifications as well as some of the technical rules you will need to abide by.
>
>That’s all for now!</br>

Good luck with this project!</br>
Sarah, CTO @Booki

After receiving all this information, you start with a pen and paper. This will allow you to define the main sections of the page before getting started with the embedding work.
Good luck!
